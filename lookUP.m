%% usage: idx = lookup(table, y)
%%
%% Lookup values in a sorted table.  Usually used as a prelude to
%% interpolation.
%%
%% If table is strictly increasing and idx=lookup(table, y), then
%%    table(idx(i)) <= y(i) < table(idx(i+1))
%% for all y(i) within the table.  If y(i) is before the table, then 
%% idx(i) is 0. If y(i) is after the table then idx(i) is table(n).
%% If the table is strictly decreasing, then the tests are reversed.
%% No guarantees for tables which are non-monotonic or are not strictly
%% monotonic.
%%
%% To get an index value which lies within an interval of the table
%% use:
%%      idx = lookup(table(2:length(table)-1), y) - 1
%% This puts values before the table into the first interval, and values
%% after the table into the last interval.

%% Changed from binary search to sort.
%% Thanks to Kai Habel <kai.habel@gmx.de> for the suggestion.

%% TODO: sort-based lookup is significantly slower given a large table
%% TODO: and small lookup vector.  This shouldn't be a problem since
%% TODO: interpolation (the reason for the table lookup in the first
%% TODO: place) usually involves subsampling of an existing table.  The
%% TODO: other use of interpolation, looking up values one at a time, is
%% TODO: unfortunately significantly slower for large tables.  
%% TODO:    sort is order O((lt+lx)*log(lt+lx)) 
%% TODO:    search is order O(lx*log(lt))
%% TODO: Clearly, search is asymptotically better than sort, but sort
%% TODO: is compiled and search is not.  Could support both, or recode
%% TODO: search in C++, or assume things are good enough as they stand.
